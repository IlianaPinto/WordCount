"Thank you for this piece. Intersected with my own memories from about the same period when my late wife and I lived in Tianjin and I taught at Nankai University and she at a foreign languages middle school, first 1985-87, then 1990-91 w/ '88-89 summer back for shorter visits. Regular trips up to Beijing allowed us time to see many of the places you note. The area of  Ritan Park you describe was a favorite place. Even shortly after June 6, 1989 (I think in fact June 7-9) when we stayed at the Ritan Hotel briefly in the wake of the demonstrations and killings, the area brought a certain calmness that disappeared as we walked toward Jianguomen Wai DaJie. I appreciate your memories and sentiments. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Between 2010 up until June of last year I visited China every year at least once and several times twice for up to three months at a time. Although I spent most of my time each trip in Hubei Province studying T'aiji at Wudangshan, each trip I arrived and departed from Beijing and chose to spend several days in the city. I always stayed in a hostel located in one or another hutongs on the west side. My favorite park was Yuetan where the Temple of the Moon is located. It's quite and very quiet - except most mornings between 10AM and noon a singer from the Beijing Opera performed with a small ensemble of Chinese musical instruments. It was fascinating, even enthralling. The entry cost was 10 Quai (about $1.65).<br/>As for the pollution there, it varied quite a bit. In early Autumn and Spring the sky was sometimes amazingly clear. At the end of November 2015 however the pollution was so thick that after we boarded our plane to leave for Seattle we were not cleared for takeoff for about twenty minutes.<br/>Beijing has riches, but it can be overwhelmingly bewildering due to its size and complexity. Two things make it less difficult than many other cities: 1. An excellent Metro system and 2. Perhaps the best airport in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Yet Beijingâ€™s streets, walls, temples, gardens and alleys were part of a carefully woven tapestry that reflected the constellations above, geomantic forces below and an invisible overlay of holy mountains and gods. It was a total work of art, epitomizing the political-religious system that ran traditional China for millenniums. It was Chinese belief incarnate.""<br/><br/>As so once was Lhasa and the rest of Tibet...",,,,,,,,,,,,
